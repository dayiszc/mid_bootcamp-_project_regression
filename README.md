# Scenario

We are working as analysts for a real estate company. The company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. 
# Objective

Our job is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

# Expected Outcomes
We encourage you to thoroughly understand your data and take the necessary steps to prepare your data for modeling before building exploratory or predictive models.

Since this is a classification model, you can use linear regression for classification for building a model. You are also encouraged to use other models in your project including KNN, decision trees for regression.

1. Explore the data
To explore the data, you can use the techniques that have been discussed in class. Some of them include using the describe method, checking null values, using Matplotlib, and Seaborn for developing visualizations.

The data has many categorical and numerical variables. Explore the nature of data for these variables before you start with the data cleaning process and then data pre-processing (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables).

2. Build a Model
Use different models to compare the accuracies and find the model that best fits your data. You can use the measures of accuracies that have been discussed in class. Please note that while comparing different models, make sure you use the same measure of accuracy as a benchmark.

3. Visualize
You will use Tableau to visually explore the data further. The questions have been provided in this document for which you can use tableau.
